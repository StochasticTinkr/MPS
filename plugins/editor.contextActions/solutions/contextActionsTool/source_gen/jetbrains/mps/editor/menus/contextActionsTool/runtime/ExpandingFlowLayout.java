/**
 *  When using a component with a normal FlowLayout at the North or South
 *  position of a BorderLayout, some components are not displayed, when they do
 *  not fit into one row.
 *  This is because FlowLayout.preferredLayoutSize expects that only one row is
 *  used, but FlowLayout.layoutComponent uses multiple rows, when there is not
 *  enough space for all components in one row.
 *  This class fixes this behavior with the result that the North/South regions
 *  of a BorderLayout are resized to show all components even with multiple rows.
