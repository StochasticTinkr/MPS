/**
 * Trace transformation of active model as it transitions from one CP to another.
 *
 * ModelTransitions with TransitionTrace pair is somewhat similar to ModelCheckpoints with CheckpointState, the former tracking
 * active transformation sequence, while latter representing recorded transformation sequence. Indeed, for the active transformation,
 * there might me partially ready recorded one, and perhaps we can reuse ModelCheckpoints. However, at the moment, access to ModelCheckpoints
 * object from CrossModelEnvironment is focused on load/restore of persisted state, and I don't want to intervene there right now. Besides,
 * for the scenario at hand, we do not really need complete CheckpointState, just a reference to checkpoint model.
