/**
 * Unlike {@link PropertyValueQuery}, this one doesn't tell its link or default resolve info (which could be easily generated from template model).
 * First of all, it's not possible from API perspective (for RTQ, we need association link prior to evaluate to populate RMC, while evaluate is our only way to
 * figure out query is missing. Second, it's little value in the association link at all (much like PVQ.getProperty(), too) - for interpreted templates, I need
 * to find appropriate meta object anyway (in TemplateNode; to figure out which property/link to copy or to process with a macro), for generated, code
 * to set property/reference would be generated right in the template code.
 * There's indeed use for detault value (both for reference and property), and this shall be added here. However, I don't want to do it right away
 * (Until {@link jetbrains.mps.generator.impl.interpreted.ReflectiveQueryProvider} knows its template model and can find nodes by QueryKey, I'd need to pass
 * this default value through QK, which I don't think is nice). Although even in that case there might be too much magic - if QK identifies a macro node, I'd
 * need to go to parent to find out defaultReferenceInfo value, while in TemplateNode everything is already there.
