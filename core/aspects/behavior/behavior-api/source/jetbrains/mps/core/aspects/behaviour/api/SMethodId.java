/**
 * Represents a unique identification for {@link SMethod} within the containing {@link SAbstractConcept} (along with all its ancestors).
 * One needs to think of it as a method signature abstraction.
 * For instance, in Java we would have it as a composite of method name and its' parameter types.
 * Currently we have it as a SNodeId of the corresponding MethodDeclaration node in the behavior model.
 *
 * Each {@link SMethod} must have an id.
 * Uniqueness must be provided within all methods belonging to all the concepts in the hierarchy
 * of the specific {@link SAbstractConcept}.
 *
 * Note that generated SMethodId is the same for all the methods overriding some base method.
