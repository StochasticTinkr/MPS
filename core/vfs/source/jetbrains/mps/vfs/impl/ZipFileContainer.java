// todo [MM] want to rewrite it as a weak ref to a ZipFile in JarEntryFile plus cache of already-created Zip-files.
// todo [MM] This should allow to remove AbstractJarFileData, ZipFileContainer and JarFileData. Also, it will make possible to collect ZipFile
// todo [MM] while JarFile is still held by someone. Last but not least, to improve readability
// this class is needed to store a pointer to a "created on demand" ZipFile for closing it when IFile holding it is collected by GC
