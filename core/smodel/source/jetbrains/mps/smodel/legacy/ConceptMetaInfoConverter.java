/**
 * Abstracts mechanism to translate string identifiers to modern meta-objects.
 * Present contract is that SConcept instances are providers for these conversions.
 * <p>
 * Implementation does best effort to provide contemporary, id-backed meta-objects. However, if it fails and no
 * such meta-object could be retrieved, implementation resorts to name-backed meta-objects.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism shall become history once we drop support for string meta-objects.
 * Primary client is editor-related code where we still use String meta-objects.
 * @deprecated this is transition code, don't use unless for intended purpose
