/**
 * Serves as a utility to cache paths which are addressed by several ways
 * For instance, the same paths are need to be accessed from the make subsystem and
 * from the stubs cite.
 * Either will be made as a separate component OR
 * (more likely) to transfer somewhere into the class loading package.
 *
 * The main clients of this class are make and class loading.
 * Not clear what's the speedup of this 'caching' so it is risky to drop it right now.
 *
 * @deprecated however I will drop it in the next release (3.4)
