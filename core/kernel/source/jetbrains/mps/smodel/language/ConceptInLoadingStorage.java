 * T could be a concept fq name or any other id-like object
 * Thread-safe storage class.
 * Using ThreadLocal to get rid of concurrency flaws.
 * ConcurrentMap is not suitable since,
 * for example, during the parallel generation we are likely to get {@link jetbrains.mps.smodel.runtime.illegal.IllegalConceptDescriptor}
 * for some of the core baseLanguage concepts (e.g. ConstructorDeclaration). Illegal behavior descriptor breaks
 * the generation, so that implementation is unacceptable.
 *
 * We do need such a storage because there might be invocation cycle
