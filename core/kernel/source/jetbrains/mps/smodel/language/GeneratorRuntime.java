 *   (b) idea module structure (e.g. generator-engine split to api and impl; or kernel split to keep LanguageRuntime separate)
 *   (c) what messages outer world may want to send to generator runtime

   * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Now GeneratorRuntime is instantiated with appropriate runtime instance of its language, which is
   * natural given the way generators are declared. However, another approach seems more general and is worth considering:
   * (a) GeneratorRuntime could answer SLanguage/set{SLanguage} itself (GR instantiated using no-arg default constructor)
   * (b) GR doesn't tell its source language, instead, this information is recorded externally e.g. in module descriptor/manifest
   * Though (b) is most flexible, (a) seems to be aligned with the rest of MPS and more convenient provided we need to go from GR to LR and back.
   * (c) LanguageRuntime of source language is kept internally by GeneratorRuntime, and it registers/unregisters itself with API of attach/detach (to hide
   * implementation details, although LR is hardly an implementation detail to hide)
   * @return language this generator is associated with
