/**
 * EXPERIMENTAL FUNCTIONALITY, DON'T USE OUTSIDE OF MPS.
 *
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT! Instances of the class are stateful and shall not be reused!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Facilitates {@link org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.module.ModelAccess} to cancel model read actions.
 * Pass instance of this class instead of a regular {@link Runnable} to {@link org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.module.ModelAccess#runReadAction(Runnable)}
 * or {@link org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.module.ModelAccess#runReadInEDT(Runnable)} to indicate the outcome of read action is not
 * essential/vital and the action could get cancelled.<br/>
 * Beware, {@link org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.module.ModelAccess} implementation is not obliged to honour this kind of runnables. If it does, it sends
 * {@link #cancel()} request to all {@code CancellableReadAction} at its own discretion, usually when a write or command action comes up.
 * Depending on {@code ModelAccess} implementation, it might not be reasonable to use {@code CancellableReadAction} from a thread that is
 * dedicated to writes/commands (e.g. EDT) as there's no chance for cancellation then.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  Read action may get cancelled prior to start and therefore subclass may not get control at all. Subclasses shall check {@link #isCancelRequested()} from
 *  time to time (as appropriate with respect to own safe locations) and stop execution as soon as possible once the flag has been noticed. Subclasses shall
 *  invoke {@link #confirmCancel()} in case they terminate execution according to {@link #isCancelRequested()} request, and shall not perform any special
 *  activities if they complete in a regular fashion.<br/>
 *  Right now there's no API to figure out cancellation/completion state of the action once it's over. The API might get added if a need arises.
 *  PLEASE don't try to guess internal state based on existing protected methods, introduce a dedicated, well-documented method instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There's no counterpart to support {@link jetbrains.mps.util.Computable} code that produces a value. Subclasses may declare own return value accessor with
 * proper default value for the case read action had not been started at all.
 * </p>
