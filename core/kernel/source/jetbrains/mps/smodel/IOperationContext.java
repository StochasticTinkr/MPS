/** @deprecated
 *  It appears that we always have a project and a module instances in the scope, where IOperationContext is being used.
 *  So in this case we should pass a project itself instead of passing an IOperationContext instance.
 *  The same needs to be done with a module.
 *  isValid and isTestMode are helping methods, which should be implemented in place.
 *  getComponent method should be replaced by {@link jetbrains.mps.project.Project} method getComponent for now.
 *  Later it needs to be replaced with a corresponding static method call getInstance of the component class {T}.
