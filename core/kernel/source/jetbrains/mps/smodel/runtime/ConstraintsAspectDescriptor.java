/**
 * LanguageRuntime is allowed to return null descriptor in case there are no constraints for language's concept defined right in the language.
 * Access to constraints from concept's hierarchy is done by ConceptRegistry at the moment.
 * We might change the contract and generate descriptor class always, delegating to superclass as appropriate, however, need to address two issues first:
 * (a) we don't want to go further than immediate superclasses (i.e. don't want to fix complete concept structure at generation time), and even for immediate
 * superclasses we'd like to grab newly added constraints, if any, without re-generation.
 * (b) if we could reference generated descriptors class directly (doesn't look feasible at the moment, due to (a), don't want to fix exact superclass to go to),
 * we might simply use delegation. Alternative is to generate a class that does a callback, so RT could pick proper superclass to go to. We don't have such
 * API yet, nor are ready to introduce it. Besides, it would be pretty much the same as present approach, with a burden of extra generated class.
 * <p/>
