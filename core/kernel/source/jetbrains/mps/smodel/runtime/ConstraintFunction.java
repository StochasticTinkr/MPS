/**
 * Presents a constraint function.
 *
 * Constraint function supplies a {@link Context} in which constraint function are applied.
 * Resulting constraint contains a "sequence" of objects that are applicable/valid in this context.
 *
 * In case, when result has {@code boolean} type, it means that supplied context is valid if function returns true.
 *
 * If constraint function returns {@code null}, it means that this constraint function doesn't provide any restrictions
 * for these context. Basically, it means that any "object" is valid in this context.
 *
 * INHERITANCE NOTES:
 *
 * If constraint isn't defined externally, it should be calculated as composition of constraints defined in super concepts.
 * For boolean-returning constraints it means that constraint composition returns true only if all super-concept constraints returns true.
 * For scope-returning constraints it means that constraint composition returns a scope that contains nodes which are contained in all scopes
 * provided via super-concept constraints.
 * For other kinds it depends on implementation.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Assuming, there is concepts A, B, C, D:
 *  A extends B, C;
 *  B extends D;
 *  C extends D.
 *
 * There is no externally-defined 'can be child' constraint function (from now, CF) in concept A. Let predict calculated constraint function for cases:
 * 1) CF defined only in B  =>  CF for A returns same as CF for B
 * 2) CF defined only in D  =>  CF for A returns same as CF for D
 * 3) CF defined in B and C  =>  CF for A returns true only if CF for B & C returns true
 * 4) CF defined in D and redefined in B  =>  CF for A returns true only if CF for B & D returns true (but not only CF for B)
 *
 *
 * @param <Context> constraint function context type.
 * @param <Result> resulting constraint type.
