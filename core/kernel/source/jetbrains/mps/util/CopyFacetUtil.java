/**
 * This class was created to extract configuration of CopyGeneratedScripts facet
 * from jetbrains.mps.build language. This functionality used inside MPS core
 * (jetbrains.mps.lang.plugin), so we cannot introduce dependency on jetbrains.mps.build
 * language (located inside separate plugin) there.
 * <p/>
 * In the future we should design separate language to perform resource copy operations.
 * This language should be a part of MPS core.
 * <p/>
 * @deprecated the class has been superseded by {@code @CopyOutput} annotation of jetbrains.mps.lang.makeup language.
