   * Source capable of producing MacroHelper instances.
   * XXX need to decide whether this source has to be generic or have specific methods for typical usage scenarios (like module, etc). In latter case,
   *     would be nice to have a dedicated method for project. OTOH, it's unlikely we can specify all possible usage scenarions, and former approach, then,
   *     is more appealing (specific Source, e.g. the one aware of module files and their locations) would get instantiated where appropriate.
   * <p/>
   * Implementation note. Implementors of this interface that have no idea how to support specific methods are free to return  more general instance, usually
   * {@linkplain #global() global one}.
