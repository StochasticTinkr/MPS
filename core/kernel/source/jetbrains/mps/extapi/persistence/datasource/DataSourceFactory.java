 * Service-provider interface for creating a new {@link DataSource} from the given model name.

 *
 * It is somehow vital to extract the strategy defining the location (data source) of the new model
 * when the name is given. One could choose the place to store a model in various ways depending on
 * structure of the model name (for example if we are java-minded we might store a model with a name
 * 'my.favourite.package.modelName' as a folder cascade: 'my/favourite/package/modelName.mps').
