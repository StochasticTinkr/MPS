/**
 * NODE STATES
 * A node can have 2 states: it can be either attached to some repository or not.
 * In case it's not attached, it behaves just like any simple Java object.
 * After getting attached to a repository, the node starts checking correct read/write access permissions (locks) through repository.getModelAccess()
 * and also starts sending notifications about node reads.
 * <p/>
 * CHILDREN
 * Child nodes must have a global ordering meaning that the order in which child nodes are returned by getNextSibling, getPrevSibling, getChildren
 * and other methods, must be consistent with order determined by child add operations. The ordering should be consistent not only for children in
 * any particular role, but also for nodes with different roles.
 * <p/>
 * NODE MANIPULATION
 * After detaching from a model, the node is held in a special place in the repository until the end of the current Command
 * (UnregisteredNodes/ImmatureReferences) so that all references in the node and from the outside still work.
 * E.g. we have A,B and C nodes in model M, where A and B references C. After
 * C.delete or M.removeRoot(C) or C.getParent().removeChild(C), A and B will still have C as a target of reference until the end the current command.
 * If a node has been detached from its parent, it becomes detached from the whole tree. SModel.getRootNodes will not return it as a root in this case.
 * <p/>
 * STORING NODES
 * Keeping references to nodes between subsequent read actions will cause errors and possible memory leaks. See getReference()
 * <p/>
 * EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS
 * SNode represents the raw node in the AST. SNode does not know about constraints, behavior, getters and setters
 * for props/refs.
 * <p/>
 * READ NOTIFICATIONS
 * Accessing node triggers read notifications ({@link org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.model.SNodeAccessListener} and legacy 'event casters').
 * Notifications for a node are dispatched the moment node is made available to outer world, not the moment its property or reference is read, i.e.
 * if we read 3 properties and 2 references of a node A, we get single nodeRead(A) followed by 3 propertyRead() and 2 referenceRead() notifications.
 * <p/>
