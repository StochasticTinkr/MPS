/**
 * This interface can be implemented to track model state.
 *
 * Generally, we try to send most specific event only, e.g.
 * if a model content is replaced, we likely to send only {@link #modelReplaced(SModel)}, not a sequence of
 * {@link #modelUnloaded(SModel)}, {@link #modelLoaded(SModel, boolean)}, {@link #modelReplaced(SModel)}.
 * However, at the moment we do not ensure this, and chances are you get different sequence for different models.
 * FIXME we lack tests that state aforementioned contract for notifications.
 *
 * FIXME may be useful to provide modelChanged() notification to avoid attaching node change listeners just to figure out if model has been changed.
 * Event makes sense for EditableSModel only, perhaps, could be a separate listener, then?
