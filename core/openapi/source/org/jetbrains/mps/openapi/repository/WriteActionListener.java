 * Represents a listener to start/finish notifications of

 *
 * NB: clients are guaranteed that there is a write lock inside actionStarted and actionFinished.
 * If a write action is triggered inside a listener, no new events are fired.
 *
 * If a listener attached inside a write action then the {@link #actionStarted()} will be triggered automatically,
 * again if a listener detached inside a write action then {@link #actionFinished()} will be triggered before the actual detach happens.
 * Thus client can rely on the fact that there will be always preceding call of #actionStarted before the call of #actionFinished.
