Notes organizer
===============

A sample language that allows entering notes/tasks in an organized manner, categorizing them, setting their priorities and managing their states.

The sample attempts to illustrate the approaches necessary to build form-like user interfaces.

Several alternative editors have been defined to give the user various visualization options. The editor also supports filtering and sorting of displayed elements and so mimicks the capabilities of classical form-based applications.
