Robot Kaja
==========

MPS sample robot language. Allows users to program scripts for a virtual robot to let him walk around a rectangular space, pick or drop items and avoid walls.
Consider watching [an introductory MPS screen-cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPU99grx28E) to see the language in action.
