/**
 * Interface for deletion highlighting
 * <p>
 * Deletion highlighting should occur when more cells than currently selected will
 * be deleted by pressing backspace.
 * Whether this functionality is used depends on checkbox in Editor->General->Two phase deletion
 * <p>
 * Two phase deletion means that there is a first phase checking if all the cells that will
 * be deleted match currently selected cells. If they do match, deletion proceeds immediately.
 * If they don't match, all cells that would be otherwise deleted are highlighted.
 * The interface method approveForDeletion executes this first phase.
 * <p>
 * Second phase is a simple deletion of highlighted cells once they were approved previously.
 * This can be checked by isApprovedForDeletion.
 * <p>
 * By default, this is checked by all original deletion actions of MPS.
