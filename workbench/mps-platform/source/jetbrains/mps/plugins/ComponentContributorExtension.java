/**
 * A replacement for {@link PluginFactoriesRegistry}. MPS used to generate ModelName_PluginInitializer class for a model with
 * {@code IdeaInitializerDescriptor} and uses of {@code lang.plugin.standalone}. The class injects a factory into {@link PluginFactoriesRegistry}
 * which contributes app/project component parts (declared with {@code lang.plugin.standalone} constructs) with the help of {@code BaseApplicationPlugin}
 * or {@code BaseProjectPlugin} subclasses. As the only need for this initializer is to have {@code PluginContributor} adapter for {@code PluginLoaderRegistry}
 * ready, the idea is to replace it with extension point {@code PluginLoaderRegistry} could query when appropriate.
 *
 * Note, uses of this extension point reside in [mps-workbench], {@code PluginLoaderRegistry}. To me, it looks odd as plugin management is not necessarily part
 * of workbench only, therefore this extpoint lives in [mps-platform]. I'm open to discussions, though.
