   *
   * DESIGN NOTE: after considering 2 alternatives, to pass platform via dedicated setter and as and argument to {@link #init()}, I've picked the
   * one with setter: (a) not to expose Platform to every class out there unless I'm sure it's what is really reasonable; (b) there are few
   * scenarios at the moment that might need a platform access, don't want to regenerate all subclasses; (c) it's easy to add init(Platform) later.
